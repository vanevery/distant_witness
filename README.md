Distant Witness is an open source platform in development which connects an individual mobile user (witness) with a remote partner (distant witness) via real-time video.

Features:
- Live video recorded on the mobile device and the network
- Location tracking of mobile user
- Live two way audio and video
- Real-time text messaging capabilities

These features support witnesses by enabling live guidance and increased leverage through the distant witness. Distant witness also allows for immediate assistance or amplification should there be a need.

Use the Distant Witness app on the mobile device and see the live video on the remote partnerâ€™s display.
